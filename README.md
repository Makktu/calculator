# CALCULATOR APP

The ODIN Project again, and this time the assignment is to create a calculator app.

I'm starting out intending to produce an old-school 1970s look, red digits on black background, but first the basic functionality.

UPDATE: 28 Jul 2021

I have completed the project, albeit in maximum Spaghetti-code style. I will submit and regard it complete. It works. Coding purists had best not look at the source code...

The positive takeaway here is that I know where I went wrong early on and where I _kept_ going wrong. My next project should be that much improved for the experience gained in this one.
